            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Number systems are the methods used to represent and process quantities. While humans typically use the Decimal system, computers use the Binary system because it aligns with the two states of electronic circuits: ON (1) and OFF (0).</p>

            <h2>Binary Arithmetic</h2>
            <p>Binary arithmetic follows the same logic as decimal arithmetic but is much simpler because it only uses two digits.</p><br>
            <p><strong>A. Binary Addition</strong><br><br>
​When you add two 1s, the result is 0 and you carry over 1 to the next column.</p>
            <p>0 + 0 = 0</p>
            <p>0 + 1 = 1</p>
            <p>1 + 0 = 1</p>
            <p>1 + 1 = 10 (Write 0, carry 1)</p>
            <p>1 + 1 + 1 = 11 (Write 1, carry 1)</p><br>
            <p><strong>B. Binary Subtraction</strong><br><br>
                ​If you need to subtract 1 from 0, you must borrow 1 from the next higher-order column.</p>
            <p>0 - 0 = 0</p>
            <p>1 - 0 = 1</p>
            <p>1 - 1 = 0</p>
            <p>10 - 1 = 1 (0 becomes 10 after borrowing)</p>

            <h2>Why it matters?</h2>
            <p>Understanding these systems is crucial because:</p>
            <p><strong>Data Representation: </strong>All files (text, image, video) are ultimately stored as binary strings.</p>
            <p><strong>Efficiency: </strong>Hexadecimal and Octal are used by programmers to read long binary sequences more easily (1111 in binary is just F in Hex).</p>
            <p><strong>Hardware Logic: </strong>CPU circuits are built using logic gates that perform these exact binary operations billions of times per second.</p>

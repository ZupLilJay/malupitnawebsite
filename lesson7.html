          <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
          <p>Refers to remote network-based services:</p>
          <p><strong>Deployment Models: </strong>Public (AWS, Azure), Private (OpenStack), Community (FedRAMP), Hybrid (Azure Stack) – each with distinct uses.<br><br>
​
             <strong>Service Models: </strong>IaaS (infrastructure like VMs), PaaS (app development platforms), SaaS (ready-to-use software), FaaS (event-driven code execution) – with examples like Google Workspace, AWS EC2.<br><br>
​
             <strong>Advantages: </strong>Scalability, cost efficiency, better management.<br><br>
​
             <strong>Disadvantages: </strong>Security threats, vendor lock-in, service disruptions.<br><br>
​
             <strong>Applications: </strong>Used in banking, healthcare, education, government, big data analytics, and more.</p>

            <h2>Computing and Social Science</h2>
            <p>Social science explores the complexities of human society and interpersonal relationships through diverse research methods like anthropology and sociology. While it utilizes both quantitative and qualitative data, it often emphasizes qualitative insights to understand human behavior and societal evolution over time. Computing technology has modernized this field by enabling the collection of large-scale data through online polls, censuses, and social media trend analysis. Furthermore, digital tools such as educational websites, laptops, and projectors have bridged geographic gaps and enhanced the way social knowledge is taught and shared.</p>

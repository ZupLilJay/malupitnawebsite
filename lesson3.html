            <h2>Overall</h2>
            <p>A computing system is an integrated set of hardware and software components designed to process data and execute programs. It functions through a continuous cycle of input, processing, output, and storage to transform raw information into meaningful results. These systems range from general-purpose tools like laptops to specialized embedded devices found in household appliances. Ultimately, the synergy between these components allows technology to solve complex problems across every modern industry.</p>

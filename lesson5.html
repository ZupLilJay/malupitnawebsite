            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A Digital Logic System is the study of how computers use electronic circuits to make decisions and perform calculations. It is the "bridge" between physical electricity and the mathematical binary system.</p>

            <h2>Boolean Algebra</h2>
            <p>Digital logic is based on Boolean Algebra, where every variable is either TRUE (1) or FALSE (0). In a physical computer, these "1s" and "0s" are represented by high and low voltages.</p>

            <h2>Logic Gates</h2>
            <p>​A Logic Gate is a tiny electronic circuit that acts as a switch. It takes one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output based on a specific rule.</p>

            <h2>Types of Logic Circuits</h2>
            <p>Logic gates are combined to form two main types of circuits that power a computer:</p>
            <p><strong>Combinational Logic: </strong>The output depends only on the current inputs. An example is the Adder, which uses XOR and AND gates to perform the binary arithmetic we discussed earlier.</p>
            <p><strong>Sequential Logic: </strong>These circuits have "memory." The output depends on current inputs and previous states. This is how Registers and RAM store data even when the input changes.</p>

            <h2>How it relates to the CPU</h2>
            <p>Inside your computer’s processor (CPU), there is a component called the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). The ALU is essentially a massive collection of these logic gates. When you ask a computer to add two numbers, it sends electrical signals through a specific path of gates to produce the binary result instantly.</p>
